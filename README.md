THIS IS MADE DURING A LEARNING PROCESS

Project to predict if the given passengers survived or died during the Titanic accident. All sources given by Kaggle.
The main idea here is to use the Naive Bayes algorithm to make the prediction.
I don't know if this is the best option for the task, and I pretend to other algorithms after.
